Machine Learning is a latest __buzzword__ floating around. It desrves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of Computer Science.<br>
__What does Machine Learning really means?__<br>
Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability  to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.__Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs__ that can access data and use it to learn for themsleves.<br>
The process of learning begins with data, such as, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. __The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically__ without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.<br>

### [Hr Analytics](./Employeechurn)
![image.jpg](images/hr_analytics.png)<br><br>
- Employee churn is the overall turnover in an organization's staff as existing employees leave and new ones are hired.

- some staff turnover is inevitable, a high rate of churn is costly. Recruitment, hiring and training all require a financial outlay and a new hire may not be immediately productive in terms of creating profit
- An effort to build a model which helps in reducing the churn rate for a company.

- A churn with respect to the Telecom industry, is defined as the percentage of __subscribers moving__ from a specific service to a service provider to another in a period of time.
- Research shows that the companies have an __avergae churn of 1.9 to 2 percent__ month on month and annualized churn ranging from 10 to 60 percent.
- An effort to build a model which helps in reducing the churn rate for a telecom company.
